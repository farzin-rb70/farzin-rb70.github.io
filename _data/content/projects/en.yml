        # controller of PLA injectin machine
        In this project we use STM32F103 microcontroller for reading the termocuple ,read 
        isolated  array input, controle the linear motor with realTime FB, read ruller 
        (ADC 12 bit) , lcd HMI with serial interface , and use esp8266 for log and remote controll.
        termocuple have a isolated interface designing and we used fast signal isolator, and only
        one termocuple ic!!!

        # digital torniquet
        A tourniquet is a constricting or compressing device used to control venous and arterial
        circulation to an extremity for a period of time. Pressure is applied circumferentially to
        the skin and underlying tissues a limb; this pressure is transferred to the vessel wall
        causing a temporary occlusion.

        There are a number of commercially available tourniquets available for pre-hospital and
        hospital patients of exsanguinating extremity trauma. While there are potential risks
        involved in the utilization of tourniquets, expeditious and clinically appropriate
        application in the presence of potentially life threatening hemorrhage is in keeping not
        only with the standards of medical professionals, but accordingly so with the best interests
        of the patient.
